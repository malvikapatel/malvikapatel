## Hi there! 👋 I'm Malvika Patel

I am an aspiring software developer in my third year as a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. 

I am passionate about software development (full-stack), firmware engineering and machine learning/AI. I have developed a solid foundation in computer science principles and I attain a strong desire to leverage my skills to solve complex problems and drive innovation. 
My projects revolve around a variety of topics ranging from web-applications to machine learning and natural language processing. 
I have gained experiences in android development, machine learning and full-stack development. 

I enjoy reading books 📚, working out 🏋🏽‍♀️, painting 🎨 and connecting with new people 😀!
